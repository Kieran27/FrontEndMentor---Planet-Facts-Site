## About

This is a solution to the [Planets fact site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f). It was built with vanilla Javascript and fetches data from a local JSON file. Styling was done through CSS and CSS animations.

### What I Learned

This project was an introduction to working with JSON and using the fetch API from Javascript. On the design side, this project was challenging attempting to closely replicate the desktop, tablet and mobile design as well as syncing the UI between each state.

This project definitely made me much more comfortable in responsive design as well as using tools such as flexbox and media queries. Currently, the project serves as a semi-pseudo single page site, with each click switching the planet repopulating the site content with the correct planet info by using a HTML template tag. This approach did cause some styling issues, with each planet image being a different size and thus caused a few layout issues. These problems were remedied with Javascript, although the current implementation is unwieldy.

It was also very interesting to dive into CSS animations. Whilst confusing at first, I think the implementation paid off and improved the overall look and professionalism of the site.

### What I would do differently

Recreating the project with React and turning it into a SPA would be an interesting task. Adding onto the local JSON with some more pertinent extra facts or even pulling data from an external API about each planet would also be an interesting challenge to improve and add onto the website. Taking advantage of React features such as state and conditional rendering would also make syncing the UI with the content displayed much easier to work with and for others to understand.
